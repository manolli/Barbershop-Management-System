## Relationships Summary

-   **`appointments` to `clients`**: Many-to-One
    -   An appointment must have one client.
    -   A client can have many appointments.
-   **`appointments` to `employees`**: Many-to-One
    -   An appointment must be assigned to one employee.
    -   An employee can have many appointments.
-   **`appointments` to `services`**: Many-to-One
    -   An appointment is for one specific service.
    -   A service can be part of many appointments.

## Notes

-   The `uuid_generate_v4()` function needs to be available in PostgreSQL. Supabase enables the `uuid-ossp` extension by default, which provides this.
-   `updated_at` columns can be automatically updated using database triggers, for example:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION trigger_set_timestamp()
    RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
    BEGIN
      NEW.updated_at = NOW();
      RETURN NEW;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

    -- Example for the 'clients' table
    CREATE TRIGGER set_timestamp_clients
    BEFORE UPDATE ON clients
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_set_timestamp();
    ```
    This trigger would need to be created for each table with an `updated_at` column.
-   "Reports" and "Dashboard" functionalities will be primarily served by querying and aggregating data from these tables, not by dedicated tables.
